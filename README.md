# Jogo Da Velha.
 
  This game features an assembly Tic-tac-toe game that can be played in a RISC-V simulator (preferably, <a href="https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars">RARS</a> or <a href="https://github.com/LeoRiether/FPGRARS">FPGRARS</a> ). Additionaly, "version/optimizeMemory" branch contains some adaptations to run the game in a DE1-SoC FPGA.
